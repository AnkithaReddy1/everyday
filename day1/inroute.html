        The history of science studies the emergence and development of systematic knowledge. Linguistic and historiographic traditions diverge sharply as to what kind of knowledge that is (e.g., the German Wissenschaft versus the Anglophone 'science'), with significant consequences for the scope and methods of the field.

        The "Father of Sociology," according to most people, is Comte. Emile Durkheim, however, is revered as the founder of social science since he laid the groundwork for actual social study in the field of sociology.
